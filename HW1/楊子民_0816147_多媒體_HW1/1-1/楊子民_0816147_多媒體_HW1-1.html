          There is a time in every man's education when he arrives at the
          conviction that 
          <a href="##" style="color:white;" title="IMPORTANT">
            envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better for worse as his portion;</a> 
          that though the
          wide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come
          to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is
          given to him to till. The power which resides in him is new in nature,
          and none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he know
          until he has tried. Not for nothing one face, one character, one fact,
          makes much impression on him, and another none. It is not without
          preestablished harmony, this sculpture in the memory. The eye was
          placed where one ray should fall, that it might testily of that
          particular ray. Bravely let him speak the utmost syllable of his
          confession. We but half express ourselves, and are ashamed of that
          divine idea which each of us represents. It may be safely trusted as
          proportionate and of good issues, so it be faithfully imparted, but
          God will not have his work made manifest by cowards. It needs a divine
          man to exhibit anything divine. A man is relieved and gay when he has
          put his heart into his work and done his best; but what he has said or
          done otherwise shall give him no peace. It is a deliverance which does
          not deliver. In the attempt his genius deserts him; no muse befriends;
          no invention, no hope.

          Accept the
          place the divine providence has found for you, the society of your
          contemporaries, the connexion of events. Great men have always done
          so, and confided themselves childlike to the genius of their age,
          betraying their perception that the Eternal was stirring at their
          heart, working through their hands, predominating in all their being.
          And we are now men, and must accept in the highest mind the same
          transcendent destiny; and not pinched in a corner, not cowards fleeing
          before a revolution, but redeemers and benefactors, pious aspirants to
          be noble clay under the Almighty effort let us advance on Chaos and
          the Dark
